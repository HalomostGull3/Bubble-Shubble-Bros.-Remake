# Bubble-Buster-Bros.-Remake
Bubble Buster Bros. came from my grade 10, Computer Science 20 class as my final project. This game was made in Python using Pygame. This remake will encompass my learning through my time studying at the University of Saskatchewan. This game will be remade in Python.
To install:
- install python's latest version in terminal: "py -m pip install --upgrade pip"
- install pygame in terminal: "py -m pip install pygame --pre"
